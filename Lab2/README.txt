The Shell has 2 modes of operation.
1. Batch Mode; in this mode, there should be a text file named commands.txt present in the current directory. The shell will execute each command one by one till it reached the end of file.
2. Interactive Mode; the shell receives the commmands from user through input prompt and runs it.

after each successful execution either in batch of interative the user is prompted again for the choices.
